/*
 * Why Was Selection Sort Invented?
 * Selection Sort was developed as a simple, easy-to-understand sorting method.
 * It is useful for:
 * 
 * 1. Early Computers (Limited Memory)
 * Early computers had limited RAM and no dynamic memory allocation.
 * Selection Sort is in-place (i.e., it doesnâ€™t need extra memory like Merge
 * Sort).
 * 
 * 2. Simplicity & Teaching Purposes
 * It is one of the easiest sorting algorithms to understand.
 * Often used to introduce sorting concepts in programming courses.
 * 
 * 3. Minimizing Swaps
 * Selection Sort does fewer swaps than Bubble Sort.
 * While Bubble Sort swaps on every comparison, Selection Sort only swaps once
 * per pass (at the end).
 * This is useful in cases where swap operations are costly (e.g., flash memory,
 * where writes are slow).
 * 
 * Time complexity - O(n^2) O(n^2) O(n^2)
 * Space complexity - O(1)
